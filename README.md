# Overview
This repository a project, currently named "SimpleTalk," begun at the initiation of the UnitedLex computing lab. More information is to come, but an overview of the lab and its structure can be found in the [mandate document](https://github.com/dkrasner/Simpletalk/blob/master/Mandate_Public_Repository.pdf).

# SimpleTalk
A project inspired by the ideas from [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) and [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). The project is very early stages and represents our desire to think about 'authoring' environments. The goal is not so much to create a working system, although that is one, but to begin thinking about research in personal computing moving forward.

No official release at the moment and documentation to follow.

## Installation

Create a node environment like so `nodeenv --node=14.5.0 --prebuilt  .nenv` (replace 14.5.0 with whatever current version you want, and .nenv with the directory you prefer), and source `source .nenv/bin/activate`. Then run `npm install`.


## Tests

We use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for testing and [chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) for assertions. To run all tests simply do `npm test` in the root directory.
